    <h2>Research Areas</h2>
    
    <h3>Economic Impact Assessment</h3>
      <p> An economic impact analysis (EIA) examines the effect of an event on the economy in a specified area.
        The economic event analysed can include implementation of a new government policy or project, or may 
        simply be the presence of a business or organization. EIA is commonly conducted when there is public 
       concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy. </p> <br>

      <h3>Regulatory Impact Analysis</h3>
        <p> Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) examines and measures the likely benefits, 
        costs and effects of new or changed regulations. It is a useful regulatory tool 
        that provides decision-makers with valuable empirical data and a comprehensive framework 
       in which they can assess their options and the consequences their decisions may have. 
        We hold expertise in assessing regulations on a case-by-case basis to help determine 
        whether they contribute to strategic policy goals, and ensure policy-makers are well-informed.</p> <br>

    <h3>Economic Forecasting</h3>
      <p> Economists use various tools and indicators to forecast the future status of an economy. 
        Economic forecasting is mostly used to predict an economy’s growth in the near future calculated 
        in terms of its GDP.  Governmental organizations and private companies make use of the economic 
        forecasts to make important decisions that are likely to bring benefits and avoid undesirable 
        economic crises like inflation. Getting an idea about the future conditions is immensely 
        helpful to make intelligent decisions regarding finance. We cover expertie in a range of 
        forecasting methods including more tranditional one like time-series models and econometric systems 
        to more recent ones such as machine learning. </p> <br>

     <h3>Economic Sector Performance </h3>
       <p> A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively 
        a sector is achieving key government objectives. 
        For organizations that strive to provide services and solutions with economic impact, it is important
        to ensure that the KPIs chosen are well-defined and measurable. We help our clients define economic related KPIs suitable that best 
        assess the success of their project (like unemployment, jobs created, patent’s filed, new businesses created), 
        and faciliatte the collection of data relevant to their measurements. </p> <br>

       <h3>Program evaluation and Policy analysis</h3>
        <p> Program evaluation is concerned with measuring the effects of an fixed policy in 
          terms of its goals, outcomes, or criteria. 
         Policy analysis on the other hand is used when there is a 
          need to improve or legitimate the practical implications of a policy-oriented program. </p>
