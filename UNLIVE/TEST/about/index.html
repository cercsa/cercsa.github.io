    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
     The Center for Economic Research and Consulting was established by
     <a href="../team/">Professor Nourah Alyousef</a> with the ambition of
     conducting impactful research and consultancy for the Saudi Arabian economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     CERC helps organisations align their activities with the objectives of
     <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/">Vision 2030</a>.
     We provide government and non-governmental agencies with an analysis of the 
     possible economic effects of their proposed implementations of
     Vision 2030 aims.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition, we conduct research and bespoke consultancy on domestic
     and international economic themes affecting the Saudi economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     In so doing, we support the aspirations and capabilities 
     of our country to achieve its fullest economic potential.
    </p>
    <h2>Our approach</h2>
    <p>
     With the profusion of big data across sectors, and the development of ever-more
     sophisticated econometrics and machine learning, the opportunity arises 
     for a data-driven policy analysis and evalutaion that is
     based on precise, continuous, dynamic data, generated from observed behaviour.  
    </p>
    <p>
     CERC seizes this opportunity.  Our experts use tools from 
     advanced econometrics and artificial intelligence for economic analysis&mdash;including,
     but not limited to, measuring and evaluating the impact of economic
     decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     In doing this, we also draw on the confirmed experience of our experts
     and advisors, in their years of work on Saudi Arabian economics.  CERC
     is both state-of-the-art and firmly grounded in local expertise
     and our profound sense of duty to Saudi Arabia and its people.
